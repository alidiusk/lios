# lios

This is a custom 32bit operating system made from scratch named `LIOS`.
Its implementation is inspired by the renowned guide [OS Tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) that walks individuals through making their own OS from scratch.

## Building
To build `lios`, you will need:
* clang
* llvm
* ld.lld
* nasm

Clone the repository and use `make build`.

## Running

To actually run `lios`, I recommend you use [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

If you have `QEMU` installed, you can run `lios` with `make run`.
